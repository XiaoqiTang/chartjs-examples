/**
 * If you've ever played an RPG, you're likely familiar with radar graphs. They're
 *  great tools for quickly visualizing multiple dimensions of difference and creating
 *  at-a-glance insights.
 *
 * 1. Use this data to create a radar chart (or three, if you prefer) to compare the
 *  heroes below.
 *  (Statistics derived from the superhero database: https://www.superherodb.com)
 *
 * 2. Add a front end design library and try your hand at creating a "card"
 *  that displays each hero's image (look in the 'assets' directory and use an 'img'
 *  element) along with their statistics in a radar graph
 *
 * 3. As a stretch goal, try to think about abstracting the work you've just done. The
 *  database from which these records were pulled has *thousands* of entries and it would
 *  be nice if there were one function that would create a 'card' as in step 2, given one
 *  of the heroes as an argument (as formatted below)
